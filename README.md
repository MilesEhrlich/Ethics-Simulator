# Ethics Simulator: Exploring Moral Philosophy through Interactive Dilemmas

This simulator is designed to help people understand how different ethical frameworks approach real-world issues. Each simulation demonstrates the strengths and weaknesses of philosophical approaches, showing the trade-offs that come with moral decision-making. 

## 💡 Overview

This simulator provides two distinct, interactive dilemmas to demonstrate how **Utilitarianism**, **Kantian Ethics**, and **Virtue Ethics** approach complex moral trade-offs in resource allocation and professional conduct.

## I. Simulation 1: Vaccine Distribution Ethics

This simulation addresses the tension between maximizing overall societal benefit (Consequentialism) and upholding principles of duty and fairness (Deontology).

### Ethical Frameworks & Logic

| Framework | Goal | Methodological Detail | Core Conflict |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Utilitarianism** | **Maximize Total Utility** (Life-Years Saved). | Prioritizes individuals based on a calculated **Utility Score**: $$risk \times life\_expectancy \times (1 + 30\% \text{ essential bonus})$$. | Treats individuals as means to maximize the aggregate good. |
| **Kantianism** | **Fair Distribution** respecting individual dignity. | **User selects one duty-based method:** Duty of Formal Fairness (Lottery), Duty to the Weakest (Highest Vulnerability First), or Duty of Proportional Equality (Equal Distribution). | Upholds duty and fairness but may result in fewer total lives saved. |

### Features
* **Interactive Simulation**: Adjust population demographics, risk levels, and vaccine supply.
* **Detailed Metrics**: Compares Lives Saved, Life-Years Saved, and Vulnerable Protected.
* **Visual Analytics**: Chart.js visualization of comparative results.

## II. Simulation 2: The Whistleblower Dilemma

This simulation explores the moral cost of exposing corporate malfeasance, focusing on the trade-off between professional welfare and moral integrity.

### Ethical Frameworks & Core Concepts

| Pathway | Core Principle | Philosophical Focus | Key Metrics Manipulated |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Kantian Duty** | **Perfect Duty**: Truth-telling is absolute; consequences are irrelevant. | Demonstrates that the moral worth lies in the **Intention** and fulfillment of the **Categorical Imperative**. | High **Integrity Score**, very low **Welfare Score**. |
| **Utilitarian Outcome** | **Maximize Welfare**: Action is based on calculating the greatest good. | Highlights **Bernard Williams' Critique
