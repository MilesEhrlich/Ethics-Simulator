                <h2>The Situation</h2>
                <p>You are a mid-level executive at a major pharmaceutical company. During a routine audit, you discover that your company has been carefully hiding data about a life-threatening side effect of one of its best-selling medications. The side effect has already caused multiple deaths, and the company is actively hiding this information from the publicto protect profits.</p>
                
                <p><strong>You are faced with a tough decision:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>If you become a whistleblower, you will expose the truth and potentially save lives.</li>
                    <li>However, you will be blacklisted from the industry, lose your career, and your family will face severe financial trouble.</li>
                    <li>There's no guarantee that your actions will actually end up stopping the company, they might find ways to continue or delay consequences.</li>
                    <li>You have a chance to preserve your integrity, but what will result of your life?</li>
                </ul>
